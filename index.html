	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p id = 'p1'> Hello! My name is Melanie Hernandez. I am in a family of four; which involves my mom, dad, brother, and me. Together we enjoy watching movies, going out to eat, and exploring new areas. We have gone to Orlando, Florida. More specifically Disney World for one week and had a marvelous time. We laughed like never before and took photos that will last a lifetime. My family and I were daring enough to repeat the rides more than once. My parents have also taken my brother and I to Pennsylvania to Hershey Park. We went to water parks and roller coasters. I honestly think time spent with the family is time spent well.

	 <p>I honestly think time spent with the family is time spent well.
I am a ninth grader attending Francis Lewis High School. I enjoy attending my school because I relish the subjects I am studying about. I am bilingual; I know English and Spanish. Iâ€™m looking forward to learning other languages. So far I am taking Latin and Italian in my school. I believe knowing many languages would help me later on in my life. Besides just learning new languages I have a passion for volleyball, science, and photography. Whenever I have the chance I would spend my time playing volleyball with friends. I may not be the best player but this sport helps me relax and stress less on my classwork. The subject, science have always been my favorite. I have already taken the Earth Science regents and this year I am taking Living Environment. My passion for science is tremendously huge because I enjoy researching topics I may be unclear with. In addition learning something new is a life changing experience, it opens my eyes to new idea or issues going around the world.

<p>Throughout my fourteen years I have valued my health. Since I would not be able to accomplish most of my goals without having good health. But I do not only value health, I value everything that has come my way. I am extremely grateful for all the doors that have opened for me and I hope this door opens as well. </p>
